## How to Run API Testing Using Docker

### Steps:

1. **Open a New Terminal**

   - Launch a new terminal window or tab on your computer.
   - Make sure Docker is running on your system.

2. **List Running Containers**

   - In the terminal, execute the command:
     ```
     docker container ls
     ```
   - You will see a response similar to the following example:
     ```
     CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                    NAMES
     bfd5edbd157b   app-web   "sh -c 'uvicorn mainâ€¦"   40 minutes ago   Up 25 minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp   app-web-1
     ```
   - Note down `IMAGE` name from the list. In this example, the `IMAGE` is `app-web`.

3. **Run Testing Command**

   - Replace `{IMAGE_NAME}` with the actual image name (from step 2) in the following command:
     ```
     docker run {IMAGE_NAME} sh -c "pytest"
     ```
   - For example, if your image name is `app-web`, the command will be:
     ```
     docker run app-web sh -c "pytest"
     ```
   - Execute the command in the terminal to run the API tests inside the Docker container.

4. **Observe Test Results**
   - The terminal will display the output of the tests. Ensure all tests pass and check for any error messages or failures.
